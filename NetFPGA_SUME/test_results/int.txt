- TEST: Max Hop Count exceeded, no metadata added, E flag set to 1.
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. No INT metadata added to the packet if max hop count is
exceeded.
- TESTING TIME: ~76s

***

- TEST: "tot_hop_cnt" incremented after packet has been processed.
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. "tot_hop_cnt" correctly incremented.
- TESTING TIME: ~100s

***

- TEST: BOS bit indicates the last metadata instance in the stack
(added only to first hop).
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. BOS set only to the first hop, according both to
"ins cnt" and "ins_bitmask".
- TESTING TIME: ~130s

***

- TEST: Invalid TAG when info not available (broadcasting).
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. Invalid tag correctly set.
- TESTING TIME: ~118s

***

- TEST: In an INT packet, the length (in bytes) of the INT metadata stack must
always be (Instruction Count * 4 * Total Hop Count).
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. Packet length is correct.
- TESTING TIME: ~117s

***

- TEST: Instruction Count (5b), a device would cease processing an INT packet
with a Intruction Count higher than the number of
instructions that it is able to support.
- TEST RESULT: FAILED. This implementation of INT doesn't allow users to require
the execution of more than 5 instructions, it provides no mechanism for ceasing
the processing of packets requiring more than 5 instructions.
Indeed, the pipeline fails in setting the BOS flag to the last (the fifth)
INT header.
- TESTING TIME: ~103s

***

- TEST: Pipeline throughput.
- TEST RESULT: FAILED. Pass only with unaligned packet size, fail otherwise.
- TESTING TIME: ~3077s

***

- TEST: Architecture throughput.
- TEST RESULT: FAILED. The architecture cannot sustain full internal rate.
- TESTING TIME: ~3077s

***

- TEST: Generating correct metadata (switch ID, ingr port ID, Queue occupancy,
ingr TSTAMP, egr port ID).
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. Metadata correctly generated for all packet sizes.
- TESTING TIME: ~1177s
