- TEST: Invalid source MAC addresses.
- TEST RESULT: FAILED. Packets with invalid source MAC addresses traverse the
data plane and reach the output network interfaces.

***

- TEST: Two ports assigned to same MAC address.
- TEST RESULT: FAILED. Table "smac" stores all the already known source MAC address.
This prevents the second training packet from being sent to the control plane for
updating the corresponding entries in the tables.
Therefore all subsequent packets are sent to the port assigned to the first training packet.

***

- TEST: Overflow with more than 64 entries in CAM table.
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. Although table size is declared as 64 entries in the P4 code,
tables are able to store more data, thus avoding saturation when the 65th entry is loaded.

***

- TEST: Learning hazards (not enough time for updating the CAM table).
- TEST RESULT: FAILED. Control plane script is never able to update the tables on time,
to keep up with line-rate traffic.

***

- TEST: MAC addresses populated with random values.
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. Random MACs processed correctly.

***

- TEST: Design functionality.
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. Training (+miss) & hit working properly.

***

- TEST: Pipeline throughput.
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. All test packets reaching the checker are forwarded to the
correct output network interfaces.

***

- TEST: Architecture throughput.
- TEST RESULT: FAILED. The architecture is not able to sustain the full internal rate (~50Gbps).
