- TEST: Invalid source MAC addresses.
- TEST RESULT: FAILED. Packets with invalid source MAC addresses traverse the
data plane and reach the output network interfaces.

***

- TEST: Two ports assigned to same MAC address.
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. Entries are updated inside the CAM table (there is only
one entry matching on a DST_MAC address), therefore, all the packets are forwarded
to the port added by the second training packet.

***

- TEST: Overflow with more than 16 entries in CAM table.
- TEST RESULT: FAILED. 17th entry overwrites the first one without any notice.

***

- TEST: learning hazards (not enough time for updating the CAM table).
- TEST RESULT: FAILED. With packet size less than 385B.
Success with larger packets.

***

- TEST: MAC addresses populated with random values.
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. Random MACs processed correctly.

***

- TEST: Design functionality.
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. Training (+miss) & hit working properly.

***

- TEST: Pipeline throughput.
- TEST RESULT: PASSED. All test packets reaching the checker are forwarded to the
correct output network interfaces.

***

- TEST: Architecture throughput.
- TEST RESULT: FAILED. The architecture is not able to sustain the full internal rate (~50Gbps).
